# FoodRescue
This app was developed for SIT307, Mobile App Development during my third year at Deakin University.

The brief was to create an app which would allow users to post food items for collection, ideally to prevent food waste. 
Certain requirements were given in the brief, such as posting Places locations, and integrating a payment system.
